# Watch-on

This project is a netflix/steaming clone. It utilizes APIs from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to accurately provide poster images, 
ratings, and other information about different kinds of movies.

This project was made so I could learn Angular animations and to test out Angular Prime which is basically a bootstrap type library.
